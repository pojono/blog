I am always trying to improve my performance on coding. And one of the many option is to learn hotkeys in your favorite IDE. 

My personal choice is Intellij IDEA.
The keyboard on Mac is different than classic Windows keyboard, so my hotkeys are different.
Only one disadavantage is TouchBar, which do not allow to use F-keys properly.
